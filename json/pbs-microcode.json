    "description": "Processor Microcode is a layer of low-level software that runs on the processor and provides patches or updates to its firmware. Microcode updates can fix hardware bugs, improve performance, and enhance security features of the processor. This script is adapted for the Proxmox Backup Server environment and will only run on bare metal systems. If running in a virtualized environment, the script will exit. Note that firmware update mechanisms, such as Intel's Management Engine (ME) or AMD's Platform Security Processor (PSP), may vary depending on your processor and its implementation. Please consult your processor's documentation to verify if firmware updates can be applied through the operating system.",
